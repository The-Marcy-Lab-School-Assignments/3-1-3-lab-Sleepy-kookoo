# Question

What is the primary difference between an HTTP GET request and an HTTP Post request?

# Answer
    The difference is GET is for small, simple things you want to share easily, and POST is for bigger, more private things you want to send securely.

Not quite, GET requests and POST requests do different things. 

Think about the difference between GETting an instagram post in your feed vs POSTing one. 

Feel free to google other examples of get vs post relationships.
