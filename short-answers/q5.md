# Question

What is the danger behind inserting user entered information *directly* into the DOM unescaped?

# Answer
    Inserting user-entered information directly into the DOM without escaping it can expose websites to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where malicious users can inject scripts that run when other users view the page, potentially stealing sensitive data or manipulating the website's behavior without permission.
