# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer
    Using "semantic elements" in web pages refers to adding tags to your HTML code that show what each section of the pages is meant for, menu, or title. It makes using the webpage easier and improves user understanding. Non-Semantic Element: It's like using code with no labels.
