What is the "Request/Response Cycle?"

# Answer
    The "Request/Response Cycle" is asking for something (like a web page or a picture), and the server computer responds, either giving what you asked for or saying it couldn't find it.

Definitely! Make sure to keep in mind, the one who is requesting is the client. And like you said, the server would respond.
